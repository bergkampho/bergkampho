## Challenge

During the pandemic, I was asked to form a new team of 3 people to build a new product to meet the changing needs of our business.

## Solution

As the only front-end engineer on the team, I had to set up the foundation of a web app. This meant not only implementing the UI but also collaborating with the designer to turn the design into functional pages. I broke the layouts into individual UI components and grouped similar UX patterns into a design library.

I also used React Storybook to implement the UI and styled-components with theming for extra flexibility. This allowed us to create reusable UIs and apply UX patterns from the library to different features to speed up development.

## Result

The outcome was the successful launch of the beta product. This met the immediate business needs and also helped the company to raise more funds from investors and keep growing during the tough times.
