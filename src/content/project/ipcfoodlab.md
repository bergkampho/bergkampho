## Overview

- Project: Content Management System (CMS) for a restaurant website
- Client: IPC++ Foodlab
- Technologies Used: [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), HTML, CSS

## Challenges

- **Dynamic Menu Management:** The restaurant needed an easy-to-use interface for updating their food menu regularly, including adding new items, changing prices, and highlighting specials.

- **User Engagement:** Creating engaging "About Us" and "Contact Us" sections to connect with customers and provide essential information.

- **Content Updates:** Allowing non-technical staff to easily update content such as announcements, events, and blog posts.

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the website was fully responsive and looked great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

## Outcome

By developing a custom WordPress CMS, I provided the restaurant with a powerful tool to manage their online presence effectively. The website not only showcased their food menu and brand but also enhanced customer engagement and satisfaction, driving business growth.
